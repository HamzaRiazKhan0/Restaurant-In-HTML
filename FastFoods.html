    <p>A hamburger, or simply burger, is a food consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, 
        typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, 
        bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce," often a variation of 
        Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a 
        cheeseburger.</p>

    <br>
    <p>French fries are served hot, either soft or crispy, and are generally eaten as part of lunch or dinner or by themselves as a snack,
         and they commonly appear on the menus of diners, fast food restaurants, pubs, and bars. They are often salted and may be 
         served with ketchup, vinegar, mayonnaise, tomato sauce, or other local specialities. Fries can be topped more heavily, as in 
         the dishes of poutine or chili cheese fries. French fries can be made from sweet potatoes instead of potatoes. A baked variant, 
         oven fries, uses less or no oil.</p>
