    <br>
    <p>Haleem is a type of stew that is widely consumed in South Asia, the Middle East and Central Asia. 
    Although the dish varies from region to region, it optionally includes wheat or barley, meat and lentils. 
    It is made by blending or mashing the meat in the curry and serving hot with flat breads or on its own. 
    The original Haleem, which is different from this variety, is an ancient Iranian dish served with wheat, meat, cinnamon, and 
    sugar that remains popular in Iran to this day.</p>
