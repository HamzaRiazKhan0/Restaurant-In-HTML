    <h2>Peking Roasted Duck</h2>

    <br>
    <p>Peking duck is a dish from Beijing (Peking)[a] that has been prepared since the Imperial era. The meat is characterized by 
        its thin, crispy skin, with authentic versions of the dish serving mostly the skin and little meat, sliced in front of the 
        diners by the cook. Ducks bred especially for the dish are slaughtered after 65 days and seasoned before being roasted in a 
        closed or hung oven. The meat is often eaten with spring onion, cucumber and sweet bean sauce with pancakes rolled around the
         fillings. Sometimes pickled radish is also inside. Crispy aromatic duck is a similar dish to Peking duck and is popular in the 
         United Kingdom.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Kung pao chicken is Chinese-style stir-fried chicken cubes with dried chili peppers. It's a Sichuanese staple that was
         brought over to America and reinvented for local flavors and tastes. The Sichuanese version is a tad more complex, seasoned 
         with Chinese peppercorns and a large heap of dried chili peppers. The American rendition stays true to most of the original 
         ingredients, but the flavor profile is significantly sweeter and will sometimes include bell peppers.</p>

    <h2>Hot Pot</h2>

    <br>
    <p>Hot pot is less of a dish than it is an experience, encapsulating the communal dining ethos that so many Western restaurants have 
        only recently taken on. Think of it as an adaptation of the stone soup fairy tale: you team up with a group of friends to cook an
         array of ingredients—thinly sliced meats, mushrooms, head-on shrimp, Chinese lettuces, fresh noodles, and more—in a single pot 
         of simmering, seasoned broth heated on an induction burner or electric range. Once cooked to your liking, you dip it in the
          sauce of choice and eat it. Rinse and repeat until extremely full.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Dumplings are a traditional food type that is widely popular, especially in North China. Chinese dumplings consist of minced meat
         and/or chopped vegetables wrapped in a thin dough skin. Popular fillings are minced pork, diced shrimp, ground chicken, beef,
          and vegetables. Dumplings can be cooked by boiling, steaming, or frying.</p>
